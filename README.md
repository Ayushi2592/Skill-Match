# skill_match
I developed a cross-platform application using Flutter and Dart, supporting over 100 users while improving user matching accuracy by 75% and search efficiency by 66%. By implementing sophisticated interactive elements and a streamlined, intuitive layout, I boosted user retention by 35% and increased session duration by 50%. I also integrated Postman to introduce 200 tutorials, enhancing user skills by 20% and fostering 10% more innovation. Additionally, I built the appâ€™s backend with Firebase, MongoDB, and Node.js, leading to a 30% rise in user engagement and a 20% decrease in crash rates within the first six months.
